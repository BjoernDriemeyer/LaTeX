  Abstract                 = {The availability of high-resolution image radars allows estimating the orientation of vehicles from a single measurement without temporal filtering. This gives the opportunity to react even faster to certain critical traffic scenes. This paper presents an approach for estimating the orientation of a vehicle. The orientated bounding box algorithm known from literature is adapted to this end and a quality function is introduced to choose the optimal bounding box. In addition, a brute-force approach for determining the best possible outcome is presented.},
